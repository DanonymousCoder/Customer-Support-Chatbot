# Customer-Support-Chatbot

This project demonstrates how to build a customer support chatbot using the Llama 2 model and a pre-defined FAQ dataset. The chatbot is designed to handle common customer queries, providing answers from a pre-existing dataset or generating new responses using a powerful language model if the question is not available in the dataset.

Key tools and technologies used include Google Colab for the development environment, Hugging Face for model integration, and Gradio for creating an interactive web interface. The chatbot dynamically learns from new queries, updating its knowledge base to improve future interactions.

This setup enables scalable, automated customer support, reducing response time and ensuring customer satisfaction. By leveraging the Llama 2 model's advanced text generation capabilities, the chatbot provides a robust solution for handling both simple and complex customer queries.
